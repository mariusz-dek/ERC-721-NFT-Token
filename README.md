# ERC-721-NFT-Token

ERC-721 (NFT) Token

NFT token implementation with Openzeppelin library as standard format.

Images and NFT json are uploaded to IPFS https://app.pinata.cloud/
For example one file - [Dog by Munch](https://purple-bright-crawdad-446.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUWvJ27NEY3AYjZmxEQqC7bd7BuHCvu38oAG41U1CjLXC)

I've minted some NFTs so they are available on [Opensea testnets](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/dogz-nft-collection)
